# NFL_Scripts

This repo is a project to query NFL stats that I'm interested in, mostly used for personal Fantasy Football analysis.

Stats may not be 100% accurate, but data is pulled directly from ESPN through nflgame repository (https://github.com/BurntSushi/nflgame).
A more recent version of nflgame project is maintained at this fork: https://github.com/derek-adair/nflgame

player_scripts.py prints players at top of current position (by several stats) for current season or specified week(s).
  I can use this for waiver claims or making decisions on which players have done well.

team_scripts.py contains functions which print team level stats such as most rushing or receiving yards for a team, or yards gained against a team
  I can use this to determine which players will likely do well against a certain matchup, or if which defense matchups are likely to perform.
